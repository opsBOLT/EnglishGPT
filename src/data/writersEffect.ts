## Writer's Effect

### **Example 1: Writers Effects Oct/Nov 2023 /11**

**Paragraph 2**

Paragraph 2 uses effective vocabulary to depict the airport’s concourse as a vast maze that passengers would have to navigate through to deposit their luggage, while creating a vaguely ominous atmosphere. The phrase “eerily silent” initially portrays the concourse as a spooky, quiet place. The word “eerily” conveys how the concourse’s silence was not a normal occurrence, and the lack of noise created an odd or unsettling feeling. It helps us understand that the concourse is normally a busy, thriving area, which was currently seemingly abandoned. It could also imply that the concourse was waiting for something to happen, owing to its uncommon silence, which would be effective foreshadowing. “Roped-off labyrinths” describes the concourse’s queue areas as twisting and confusing, in which passengers may get lost in. “labyrinths” uses effective comparison to create this effect. It emphasizes how the concourse may have a foreboding feeling to it, due to its maze-like structure and uncanny atmosphere. “Surrendered into safe hands” depicts the Golden Tour staff as saviors and protectors who would ensure the safety of passengers’ belongings, presumably from dangers present in the concourse. However, “surrendered'' could imply passengers being unwilling to let go of their belongings, despite having no choice but to. Overall, the paragraph creates a spooky effect to describe the concourse, contrasted by the Golden Tour’s offered protection.

**Paragraph 4**

Paragraph 4 depicts the approaching passengers as in need of assistance through its usage of vocabulary and comparisons. “Small knot of passengers wandering uncertainly” – this phrase uses multiple descriptive words to portray the passengers as worried or clueless about their surroundings, in dire need of help. “Small knot” initially shows us that they may be afraid to wander around alone, due to being worried about getting lost in a new environment. “Wandering uncertainly” expands on their lack of knowledge surrounding the concourse, as it shows how the passengers are simply moving about without any real purpose, unsure of what further steps to take. “Shaky dance” conveys how even their trolley seemed nervous. It shows us how their uncertainty showed in every step they took, and their lack of knowledge caused them to be unable to properly handle the trolley. It could also convey the absolute anxiety felt by the passengers while simply walking through through the concourse, which seemed to transfer over to their trolley as well. “Three disobedient suitcases” this phrase uses personification to heighten the sense of struggle as felt by the passengers. It showed how their stress and worry was not just due to inexperience, but also due to their circumstances adding more obstacles to their path. It depicted how there may be more to their anxious attitude than being in a new place, but also due to being unable to handle multiply problems such as the suitcases at once. “Disobedient” shows how the suitcases’ falling off was not a fault on their part, but rather, the suitcases’. Overall, the paragraph shows how the passengers were in urgent need of assistance so that they could manage their journey without any stress.

### **Example 2: 0500_w22_QP_12**

The writer uses a plethora of words and phrases to convey Veda's flair for the physical arts from an infantile age, despite her utter ineptitude in those more linguistic. It illustrates the sprouting of a superb dancer, who is likely to be misunderstood due to her non-traditional tendencies in the near future.

Firstly, the phrase "limbs urgently craving release" is a hyperbole, depicting how Veda was ensnared in her cot, which acted more like a confine than the comfortable home it was meant to be. This evinces her desire for freedom like a bird, with a passion for dexterity. This also provides insight into a potentially impatient, reckless mind which may be her undoing someday. It implies a passionate, caged being which could potentially foreshadow her parents blocking this path for her in the future.

Secondly, the phrase "hands spoke my first sentences like lotus bluds blossoming" is a simile, showing how her physical proficiency made up for her underdeveloped semantic capabilities. It depicts unconventional genius akin to that of a lotus blud blossoming, that is one of beauty and magnificence that would enchant the most austere of men. It foreshadows mockery in social environments due to linguistic ineptitude, which may lead Veda down a dark path.

Lastly, the phrase "effortlessly into the hand symbols of classical dancing" is a visual imagery, describing how Veda was able to dance without any prior knowledge, with "effortlessly" signifying a deep level of intuition for traditional culture. It depicts a smooth movement, perfectly transfigured into ancient symbols.

The effect on the reader is one of awe, while drawing a tinge of pity for the hardships Veda may face. It is also one of an ominous foreshadow, where her passion may lead her to depths to deep for one to handle.

### **Example 3: Taughtly A* Examplars**

*The overall effect of paragraph 9 is to show how skillful Sammy is as he climbs the hill like a master athlete. Firstly, the image of him "soaring through the mud" means he jumped so high it was like he flew. The verb "soar" has connotations of freedom like a bird, which suggests the course was effortless to him and how free he felt in that moment. Secondly, the image "pirouetted over the gorge" means Sammy twirled like a ballerina over the hole. The verb "pirouette" has connotations of control, mastery, and beauty, which suggests there is something artistic about how Sammy can tackle this obstacle course. Finally, the image of Sammy "swinging, swaying across with ease" means he moved with ease from one rope to another. The verb "swinging" has connotations of a monkey in a jungle, which implies that tackling Tough Mudder is natural to Sammy. All of this contrasts with how difficult the obstacle course is compared with how fluidly Sammy is able to approach the challenge.* 

*The overall effect of paragraph 10 is to show a magical and romanticized view of the underwater world. Firstly, the image of “shell-encrusted” means that the doorstep was completely covered by shells.This has connotations of being decorated by gems, showing how precious the location is and how the hotel blends in with its natural surroundings. Secondly, the image of clownfish “darting” means that the fish are rapidly zig-zagging all over. “Darting” has connotations of being agile, light and free, and this might reflect Jenny’s own excitement. Finally,the image of the anemone’s “swirling fingers” means that they aretwisting and wrapping around. “Swirling” has connotations of magic and dancing, suggesting even the landscape is performing for Jenny*

### **Example 5: Feb/March 2018 paper 22**

**Insert/Text**

**Paragraph 4:**

**Soon he was surrounded by ancient forest, footsteps muffled by centuries of discarded leaves. Myths of terrifying forest guardians suddenly seemed much more plausible as the endless acres of trees stood watch, stern sentinels of the trail. The silence was spellbinding as Bo crept onwards, down an almost subterranean tunnel of primeval greenery. Forwards, always forwards, an intruder in a magical**

**garden.**

**Paragraph 8:**

**Was it minutes or hours later? A sharp crack, loud as a gunshot, snapped him to attention. Ears straining, Bo quivered, listening for ravenous forest monsters ready to devour him in one gulp; or maybe a rogue bear or wild boar, hungry for hiker meat? Bo lifted the tent flap and peered into the gaping throat of the darkness, ready to be swallowed.**

**A* Response**

*The author describes the forest in a way which displays its ancient, yet mystical, aura. The phrase "centuries of discarded leaves" is used to denote the the way in which the leaves have accumulated over a period of time, in the absence of human intervention. An alliteration is used in the phrase "stern sentinels" to signify that the trees act as soldiers, on the lookout for trespassers. This effect is further enhanced with the use of personification in the same phrase. "Silence was spellbinding" is another phrase used by the writer to showcase the tranquility and stillness of Bo's surroundings. To explain that the forest has existed long before humanity, "primeval greenery" is used to indicate the forests age and continuity. Hence, the author clearly explains the forest in which Bo is hiking.* 

*Later on in the passage, the author describes Bo's reaction to the sudden noise in an exaggerated and overdramatic manner. For instance, in the phrase "loud as a gunshot", a simile is used to showcase Bo's fear and the startling intensity of the noise. "Ravenous forest monsters" is used to denote the imaginary creatures which Bo fears. To further enhance Bo's fear and dramatic acts, "devour him in one gulp" is used to indicate that the creatures can wolf him down easily. This is done with the help of visual imagery. The author uses a humorous tone in the phrase "ready to be swallowed" to indicate that Bo is accepting his fate of being consumed. Thus, the author vividly displays Bo's behaviour following the noise.*

### **Example 6: March 2022, Paper 1 Variant 2**

***The overall effect of paragraph 4 in "Into the Delta" is to evoke a sense of peace and deep connection with nature. The phrase "utter tranquillity of swishing through the water lilies in the open lagoons" uses auditory imagery to create a serene and calming atmosphere. The description of the mokoro as "gently floating as though blown through the perfectly clear water" further enhances this sense of peacefulness and harmony with the natural world. The imagery of the narrator "lay[ing] back on my backpack" contributes to a feeling of relaxation and being at one with the environment.***

### **Example 7**

***Insert/Text: Paragraph 1: The sand stretched before us, an ocean of gold frozen in time. Each dune rose and fell like a wave caught in perpetual motion, their crests sharp as a blade against the merciless blue sky. The sun, a tyrannical presence, beat down with such intensity that the air itself seemed to shimmer and dance, transforming the horizon into a trembling mirage. Our footprints, those temporary signatures of human presence, disappeared behind us as the wind, with delicate precision, erased all evidence of our journey. The silence was not merely the absence of sound but a presence in itself — ancient, profound, almost sacred in its completeness. As twilight approached, the landscape transformed; the harsh gold mellowed to amber, then to a soft rose, as if the desert, in its final act of the day, had decided to reveal its gentler nature.***

***Paragraph 2: The fishing village clung to the coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull, stubborn and enduring against the Atlantic's relentless assault. Weathered cottages, their stone faces bleached by salt and sun, huddled together as if for protection against the elements. The harbour, a patchwork of weathered boats and tangled nets, buzzed with the morning's activity — fishermen calling to one another in a dialect as rough and textured as the sea itself. The air was thick with the pungent cocktail of salt, fish and seaweed — an aroma that visitors wrinkled their noses at but that locals breathed in like perfume. Gulls wheeled overhead, their mournful cries punctuating the constant percussion of waves against rock. This place existed in a different tempo to the modern world, its rhythms dictated not by digital clocks but by tides and seasons, a living reminder of an older, slower way of life.***

***A\* Answer Paragraph 1:***

***The writer uses personification to establish the desert as a conscious entity with agency rather than merely a passive landscape. This is evident when 'the wind, with delicate precision, erased all evidence of our journey'. By attributing intentional, careful action to the wind through phrases like 'delicate precision' and the verb 'erased', the writer suggests the desert actively removes human presence. The contrast between the 'delicate' nature of this action and its complete effectiveness emphasises the desert's power \- it doesn't need brute force to remove traces of humanity, just subtle persistence. This contributes to the passage's theme of human insignificance against natural forces, reinforcing how temporary our impact is on such ancient landscapes. The personification creates a sense that the desert itself is an ancient, conscious entity that has witnessed countless human travelers come and go, leaving no lasting mark on its timeless existence.***

***A\* Answer Paragraph 2:***

***By describing how 'The fishing village clung to the coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull, stubborn and enduring against the Atlantic's relentless assault', the writer creates a sense of the village as resilient and determined despite harsh conditions. Through this powerful combination of simile and personification, enhanced by carefully chosen adjectives like 'stubborn' and 'enduring' set against the personified 'assault' of the ocean, the writer establishes a vivid impression of tenacity. The barnacle comparison is particularly effective because barnacles are small yet incredibly tenacious creatures that survive in hostile environments — making them the perfect metaphor for this human settlement. The militaristic language of 'assault' skillfully establishes the relationship between village and sea as adversarial, suggesting an ongoing battle the village refuses to lose despite being perpetually outmatched in size and force. Rather than simply describing the village as 'located on the coast', this evocative phrasing establishes the central conflict of human persistence against natural forces that defines the village's character, immediately positioning readers to admire its inhabitants' determination and resilience in the face of constant environmental challenges.***

## 5. Question 2 d: Writer’s Effect (Language Analysis)

### Overview

- Total marks: 15  
- Recommended time: about 25 minutes (5 minutes planning and 20 minutes writing)  
- Focus: language in two specified paragraphs  

## The Structure Formula

**Overall structure:**

- One overall effect sentence for the first paragraph.
- Three images or short quotations from the first paragraph, each analysed with meaning, connotations and effect.
- One overall effect sentence for the second paragraph.
- Three images or short quotations from the second paragraph, each analysed in the same way.


### Step by Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Overall Effect Sentence

Start each main paragraph with a sentence such as:

- “The overall effect of paragraph one is to…”  

Common overall effects include:

- Creating tension or suspense.  
- Showing contrast between characters or situations.  
- Creating humour.  
- Suggesting something magical or romantic.  
- Showing vulnerability or innocence.  
- Creating mystery or an eerie atmosphere.  
- Suggesting danger.  
- Creating a sense of awe.  

#### Step 2: Choose Three Images per Paragraph

- Select the three most vivid and powerful images or words from each paragraph.  
- Avoid very plain or obvious descriptive words.  
- It is vital that your quotations are ones that appear on the mark scheme.  

#### Step 3: Quote, Meaning, Connotations, Effect

Meaning:

- Explain what the words literally mean.  
- Give simple synonyms or a brief explanation.  
- Example: “stomping” literally means “walking or marching very heavily”.  

Connotations:

- Explain the associations that the word or image carries.  
- For example, “stomping” suggests elephants, force and dominance.  

Effect:

- Explain what the writer is suggesting.  
- Explain the impact on the reader.  
- Explain how this contributes to the overall atmosphere or characterisation.  
- Example: “This suggests Benson is trying to assert his dominance and makes him seem intimidating.”  

### Language Features to Look For

- Metaphors and similes.  
- Personification.  
- Strong, precise verbs.  
- Vivid adjectives.  
- Sensory details such as sound, touch, taste and smell.  

---

### Example of Analysis

Paragraph:

“Benson stomped his way to the starting line. His gaze met mine, an unspoken challenge that knocked away my certainty.”  

Analysis:

The overall effect of this paragraph is to create tension and rivalry between the two competitors.

Firstly, the image “stomped his way” means he walked heavily to the starting line. The verb “stomped” has connotations of weight, aggression and dominance, which makes Benson seem threatening and confident. This heightens the tension between him and the narrator.

Secondly, the phrase “unspoken challenge” suggests a confrontation without words. The idea that the challenge is unspoken implies that the rivalry is obvious to both characters and creates a sense of silent hostility.

Finally, the expression “knocked away my certainty” means that the narrator’s confidence has been removed. The verb “knocked” has violent connotations, as if the narrator’s self belief has been hit and destroyed. This emphasises how powerful the moment feels and how intimidating Benson appears.  

---

### Mark Scheme Bands for Writer’s Effect

Level 5 (13 to 15 marks):

- Six well chosen quotations from the two paragraphs.  
- Clear explanation of meaning for most quotations.  
- Several precise, developed comments on effect.  
- Imaginative and detailed interpretations.  

Level 4 (10 to 12 marks):

- Five or six quotations.  
- Clear explanations of meaning.  
- Several clear comments on effect.  

Level 3 (7 to 9 marks):

- Around five quotations.  
- Some explanation of meaning.  
- Some basic comments on effect.  

### Common Mistakes in Writer’s Effect

1. Focusing on labelling devices (metaphor, simile) instead of explaining effect.  
2. Selecting quotations that are not on the mark scheme.  
3. Forgetting to write an overall effect sentence for each paragraph.  
4. Skipping the literal meaning and going straight to effect.  
5. Analysing the wrong paragraphs.  
6. Choosing very simple or obvious quotations.  
7. Writing in note form instead of full sentences.  

### Things You Should Do

1. Follow the structure closely every time.  
2. Use sentence starters such as “The overall effect…”, “Firstly, the image of…”.  
3. Always explain meaning before moving on to effect.  
4. Use language such as “suggests”, “implies”, “creates” and “emphasises”.
