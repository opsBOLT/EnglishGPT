## 2. Question 1: Reading Comprehension

### Question 1 (a) to (e): Short Answer Questions

#### Key Principles

- Unless the question says that you must use your own words, you should copy directly from the text.  
- The number of marks tells you how many points you need.  
  - For 2 marks, give 2 separate pieces of information.  
  - For 3 marks, give 3 separate pieces of information.  
- Read the questions first, then go back and locate your answers in the text.  
- Do not read the entire text in detail at the start; scan for what you need.  
- Mark or highlight where you found each answer so you can check quickly.  
- Use bullet points when more than one mark is available.  
- Keep answers concise and precise.  
- Do not add explanation unless the question asks for it.  

#### Strategies by Question Type

Definition questions:

- Answer using clear synonyms or short explanations.  
- Do not repeat the word you are defining.  
- Example: “Elusive” could be defined as “mysterious”, “hidden” or “difficult to find”.  

Retrieval questions:

- Copy the exact phrases or details from the text.  

Inference questions:

- Read between the lines.  
- Example: “Why was the character surprised?” – use clues in the text rather than just quoting.  

---

### Using Your Own Words (Question 1 e)

Total marks for this question: 15  
- 10 marks for reading  
- 5 marks for writing  

#### Step by Step Process

Step 1: Read the question carefully (about 2 minutes).  

Step 2: Highlight or annotate the relevant parts of the text (usually Text B) for about 8 minutes.  

Step 3: Plan your answer (this is included in your 10 minutes of planning and thinking time).

- Number your ideas if this helps you stay organised.  
- Make sure each point is different.  
- Give a short quotation as evidence, then explain what it implies.  
- Use language like “suggests”, “implies” and “shows”.  

This is the only short answer question where paraphrasing is essential.

#### What You Need to Provide

- For 3 marks, you should give 3 separate reasons or points in your own words.  
- Avoid copying phrases directly from the text.  
- Use synonyms and different sentence structures.  
- Ask yourself: would my answer still make sense if the reader did not have the original text in front of them?  

---

## 3. Summary Writing (Question 1 f)

### The Golden Rules

1. Aim for a maximum of 120 words. The examiner will stop reading once you reach this limit.  
2. Write in continuous prose. Do not use bullet points or note form.  
3. Use your own words wherever possible. Marks are lost for excessive copying.  
4. One paragraph is preferred. Two short paragraphs are acceptable, but do not use more than two.  

### Step by Step Process

#### Identifying What You Must Summarise

- Read the task carefully. For example: “Summarise the arguments against swimming with dolphins and what responsible operators are doing.”  
- Some summary questions have two parts.  
- Use different colours or symbols to separate points for each part if there are two elements.  

#### Finding Key Points

- Aim to identify between 10 and 13 distinct points.  
- Focus on the main ideas rather than supporting examples or extra detail.  
- Group similar points together so you can combine them when writing.  

#### Step 4: Writing the Summary (about 10 minutes)

- Number your points during planning to make sure you include enough.  
- Organise your ideas logically, for example by topic or sequence.  
- Start writing as soon as you have a clear plan; you do not need an introduction.  
- Every sentence should contain at least one content point that appears on the mark scheme.  
- Use complex sentences to combine related points and stay within the word limit.  
- Link ideas smoothly so your summary reads as a single, coherent piece.  

#### Step 5: Checking Your Answer

- Count your words and write the total at the end.  
- Make sure you have not copied long phrases from the text.  
- Check that you have covered as many content points as possible within the word limit.  

---

### Mark Scheme: Summary Writing

#### Content (Reading) – 10 Marks

Level 5 (9 to 10 marks):

- Ten or more valid content points.  
- A wide range of relevant ideas.  
- Skilled selection and combination of material.  
- No irrelevant content.  

Level 4 (7 to 8 marks):

- Eight to nine valid content points.  
- A clear range of relevant ideas.  
- Some selection of material.  
- Very little irrelevant content.  

Level 3 (5 to 6 marks):

- Six to seven content points.  
- Some relevant ideas, but also some irrelevant material.  

#### Writing – 5 Marks

Level 5 (5 marks):

- Written almost entirely in your own words.  
- Well structured and logically organised.  
- Uses complex sentences effectively.  
- Spelling, punctuation and grammar are almost always accurate.  

Level 4 (4 marks):

- Mostly written in your own words.  
- Clearly organised.  
- Some variety of sentence structures.  
- Spelling, punctuation and grammar mostly accurate.  

Level 3 (3 marks):

- Some paraphrasing, but also copying.  
- Generally clear but not always well organised.  
- Frequent minor errors in language.  

---

### Paraphrasing Techniques for Summary

- Change word class: for example, “destruction” can become “destroys”.  
- Use synonyms: for example, “harmful” can become “damaging” or “dangerous”.  
- Restructure sentences, such as changing from active to passive or breaking long sentences into shorter ones.  
- Combine two related points into one sentence when appropriate.  

### Common Summary Mistakes to Avoid

-  Writing an introduction or conclusion when none is required.  
-  Including examples when the question asks for main points only.  
-  Copying whole phrases directly from the text.  
-  Exceeding the 120 word limit.  
-  Adding irrelevant information that is not required by the question.  
-  Using bullet points instead of continuous prose.  

### Pro Tips for Summary Questions

- If you are unsure whether something is a valid point, it is usually safer to include it as long as it fits the task.  
- Use linking words such as “as well as”, “furthermore” and “additionally” to connect ideas smoothly.  
- Vary your sentence structure to make your writing clear and fluent.  
- Aim to include at least ten content points if possible.  

---

### Question 2 c: Select and Explain One Quotation

Total for this question: 3 marks  
- 1 mark for an appropriate quotation  
- 2 marks for a clear explanation  

#### Example Question

“What does the writer suggest about Jenny’s feelings?”  

#### Structure for Your Answer

-  Select one quotation from the lines given in the question.  
-  Explain three different things this quotation shows about the character, setting or atmosphere.  
-  Make sure each explanation is separate and distinct.  

#### Example Format

- Quotation: “energizing fresh water shower”  
- Point 1: The word “energizing” shows that Jenny feels enthusiastic and refreshed.  
- Point 2: The phrase “fresh water” suggests she appreciates simple, natural experiences.  
- Point 3: The word “shower” implies she is fully embracing the situation rather than avoiding it.  

You only need one well chosen quotation. Do not select several short quotes for this question.

---

## 4. Question 2: Short Vocabulary Questions (2 a to 2 c)

### Question 2 a and Question 2 b: Word Meanings

#### Question 2 a: Find Words in the Text

- Copy the exact words or phrases that match the given meanings.  
- These questions usually carry one mark per correct word.  
- Skim and scan the text to locate suitable synonyms.  

#### Question 2 b: Define Using Your Own Words

- Provide clear synonyms or short explanations.  
- Do not repeat the original word in your definition.  
- Be as precise as you can.  
- Example: If the text says “The car was clamped to the ground”, suitable definitions might include “seized”, “grabbed” or “held tightly”, rather than the very general word “held”.  

---

## 5. Question 2 d: Writer’s Effect (Language Analysis)

### Overview

- Total marks: 15  
- Recommended time: about 25 minutes (5 minutes planning and 20 minutes writing)  
- Focus: language in two specified paragraphs  

## The Structure Formula

**Overall structure:**

- One overall effect sentence for the first paragraph.
- Three images or short quotations from the first paragraph, each analysed with meaning, connotations and effect.
- One overall effect sentence for the second paragraph.
- Three images or short quotations from the second paragraph, each analysed in the same way.


### Step by Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Overall Effect Sentence

Start each main paragraph with a sentence such as:

- “The overall effect of paragraph one is to…”  

Common overall effects include:

- Creating tension or suspense.  
- Showing contrast between characters or situations.  
- Creating humour.  
- Suggesting something magical or romantic.  
- Showing vulnerability or innocence.  
- Creating mystery or an eerie atmosphere.  
- Suggesting danger.  
- Creating a sense of awe.  

#### Step 2: Choose Three Images per Paragraph

- Select the three most vivid and powerful images or words from each paragraph.  
- Avoid very plain or obvious descriptive words.  
- It is vital that your quotations are ones that appear on the mark scheme.  

#### Step 3: Quote, Meaning, Connotations, Effect

Meaning:

- Explain what the words literally mean.  
- Give simple synonyms or a brief explanation.  
- Example: “stomping” literally means “walking or marching very heavily”.  

Connotations:

- Explain the associations that the word or image carries.  
- For example, “stomping” suggests elephants, force and dominance.  

Effect:

- Explain what the writer is suggesting.  
- Explain the impact on the reader.  
- Explain how this contributes to the overall atmosphere or characterisation.  
- Example: “This suggests Benson is trying to assert his dominance and makes him seem intimidating.”  

### Language Features to Look For

- Metaphors and similes.  
- Personification.  
- Strong, precise verbs.  
- Vivid adjectives.  
- Sensory details such as sound, touch, taste and smell.  

---

### Example of Analysis

Paragraph:

“Benson stomped his way to the starting line. His gaze met mine, an unspoken challenge that knocked away my certainty.”  

Analysis:

The overall effect of this paragraph is to create tension and rivalry between the two competitors.

Firstly, the image “stomped his way” means he walked heavily to the starting line. The verb “stomped” has connotations of weight, aggression and dominance, which makes Benson seem threatening and confident. This heightens the tension between him and the narrator.

Secondly, the phrase “unspoken challenge” suggests a confrontation without words. The idea that the challenge is unspoken implies that the rivalry is obvious to both characters and creates a sense of silent hostility.

Finally, the expression “knocked away my certainty” means that the narrator’s confidence has been removed. The verb “knocked” has violent connotations, as if the narrator’s self belief has been hit and destroyed. This emphasises how powerful the moment feels and how intimidating Benson appears.  

---

### Mark Scheme Bands for Writer’s Effect

Level 5 (13 to 15 marks):

- Six well chosen quotations from the two paragraphs.  
- Clear explanation of meaning for most quotations.  
- Several precise, developed comments on effect.  
- Imaginative and detailed interpretations.  

Level 4 (10 to 12 marks):

- Five or six quotations.  
- Clear explanations of meaning.  
- Several clear comments on effect.  

Level 3 (7 to 9 marks):

- Around five quotations.  
- Some explanation of meaning.  
- Some basic comments on effect.  

### Common Mistakes in Writer’s Effect

1. Focusing on labelling devices (metaphor, simile) instead of explaining effect.  
2. Selecting quotations that are not on the mark scheme.  
3. Forgetting to write an overall effect sentence for each paragraph.  
4. Skipping the literal meaning and going straight to effect.  
5. Analysing the wrong paragraphs.  
6. Choosing very simple or obvious quotations.  
7. Writing in note form instead of full sentences.  

### Things You Should Do

1. Follow the structure closely every time.  
2. Use sentence starters such as “The overall effect…”, “Firstly, the image of…”.  
3. Always explain meaning before moving on to effect.  
4. Use language such as “suggests”, “implies”, “creates” and “emphasises”.  

---

### Helpful Sentence Starters

- “The overall effect of paragraph one is to…”  
- “The writer creates a sense of…”  
- “This paragraph establishes…”  
- “Firstly, the image of…”  
- “The word suggests…”  
- “This has connotations of…”  
- “The effect of this is…”  
- “This implies that…”  
- “Secondly, the phrase…”  

---

### 2027 Changes to Writer’s Effect

- Only one paragraph will be analysed instead of two.  
- You will select three words or phrases in total instead of six.  
- The question will be worth 10 marks instead of 15.  
- The suggested word count will be 200 to 250 words rather than 200 to 300.  
- The extract will be printed with the question so you do not need to turn back to the main passage.  
- The question will focus on powerful or unusual words and phrases.  

#### The Ladder Method for 2027

1. Select a quotation.  
2. Give the explicit meaning.  
3. Make a first inference about the effect.  
4. Make a second, deeper inference.  
5. Make a third inference linked to wider impact or author’s purpose.  

---

## 6. Question 3: Extended Response

### Overview

- Total marks: 25  
  - 15 marks for content and structure  
  - 10 marks for style and accuracy  
- Time: around 40 minutes (10 minutes planning, 30 minutes writing)  
- Recommended length: 300 to 350 words  

Every Question 3 task includes three bullet points. You must deal with all three with roughly equal depth.

### VORPF Analysis Before Writing

Before you begin, decide:

- Voice: who are you writing as?  
- Audience: who are you writing to?  
- Register: formal, semi formal or informal?  
- Purpose: are you explaining, persuading, arguing, describing or narrating?  
- Format: letter, diary entry, speech, report, article or interview?  

### The Three Bullet Points

Typically:

- Bullet 1: how you felt when something happened, and why.  
- Bullet 2: description of events or setting and your reaction.  
- Bullet 3: your thoughts and feelings now, looking back.  

Each bullet is worth roughly five marks. Aim for three or four ideas per bullet.

### Step by Step Process

#### Step 1: Highlight the Insert (about 5 minutes)

- Use three different colours or symbols for the three bullet points.  
- Highlight the key details you will refer to.  
- Note any implicit meanings or feelings.  
- Summarise your highlights in your own words.  
- Decide on the order of your paragraphs.  

#### Step 2: Plan Your Answer (about 5 minutes)

- Decide on the voice and tone.  
- Plan a brief opening and closing sentence or idea.  

#### Step 3: Write Your Response (about 30 minutes)

- Write a short introduction, one or two sentences.  
- Write one paragraph for each bullet point.  
- End with a brief conclusion, one or two sentences.  
- Maintain a consistent character voice and register.  

---

### Mark Scheme: Content and Structure (15 Marks)

Level 5 (13 to 15 marks):

- Around ten to fifteen details taken from the text.  
- At least five ideas developed beyond simple statements.  
- All three bullet points fully covered.  
- Strong and convincing characterisation.  
- Appropriate tone maintained throughout.  

Level 4 (10 to 12 marks):

- Around eight to ten details.  
- Three or four developed ideas.  
- All three bullets addressed.  
- Clear sense of character.  
- Mostly appropriate tone.  

Key ingredients for high marks:

1. Detail: specific references to events and descriptions in the insert.  
2. Development: your own thoughts, reactions and inferences built on those details.  
3. Own words: do not copy sentences from the insert.  
4. Characterisation: the piece must sound like the character you are asked to be.  
5. Implicit ideas: especially important for the final bullet point.  

### Mark Scheme: Style and Accuracy (10 Marks)

Level 5 (9 to 10 marks):

- Ambitious and precise vocabulary.  
- Wide variety of sentence structures.  
- Consistent and appropriate register.  
- Spelling, punctuation and grammar are almost always correct.  

Level 4 (7 to 8 marks):

- Effective vocabulary choices.  
- Some variety in sentence structures.  
- Register mostly appropriate.  
- Spelling, punctuation and grammar usually accurate.

## 7. General Exam Strategies

### Before the Exam

1. Practise all question types regularly.  
2. Learn how mark schemes describe each level.  
3. Use timed practice to build speed and stamina.  
4. Read widely to improve vocabulary and reading speed.  
5. Learn standard formats for common text types.  
6. Practise paraphrasing frequently.  

### During the Exam

#### Good Exam Technique

1. Read all questions briefly at the start.  
2. Skim the texts once you know what you are looking for.  
3. Note down target finishing times next to each question.  
4. Start with Question 1 and work in order.  

#### Reading Strategies

- Read each question before reading the relevant part of the text.  
- Underline or highlight key words in the questions.  
- Annotate the text as you read.  
- Mark where you found each answer.  
- Check which text (A, B or C) each question refers to.  

#### Time Management Tips

- Write your start and end times for each question, for example “Start 10.15, End 10.30”.  
- Use a watch or clock to monitor your progress.  
- If you are stuck, move on and return later if possible.  
- Attempt every question, even if briefly.  

#### Writing Strategies

- Always plan, even if only for a minute or two.  
- Use your own words unless copying is explicitly allowed.  
- Check spelling, punctuation and grammar in the final five minutes.  
- Write as clearly and neatly as you can.  
- For the summary and Question 3, keep word counts in mind.  

### Handwriting and Presentation

- Make sure your writing is legible.  
- Cross out mistakes with a single line rather than heavy scribbles.  
- Use clear paragraphs.  
- Leave space between answers.  
- Number each answer clearly.  

You do not lose marks simply for messy handwriting, as long as it can be read. If it is very difficult to read, it may be sent to more than one examiner.

- Forgetting parts of multi part questions.  

### Summary Writing

- Writing more than 120 words.  
- Copying phrases directly from the passage.  
- Including irrelevant material.  
- Adding introductions or conclusions when they are not needed.  
- Using bullet points instead of continuous prose.  
- Including only four or five content points instead of aiming for ten or more.  

### Writer’s Effect

- Labelling linguistic devices instead of explaining their effect.  
- Picking quotations that do not appear on the mark scheme.  
- Forgetting to give an overall effect sentence.  
- Failing to explain the literal meaning.  
- Analysing the wrong section of the text.  
- Choosing very simple or obvious quotations.  

### Question 3

- Copying directly from the insert.  
- Ignoring the third bullet point, which often requires more inference.  
- Using an inappropriate voice or register.  
- Inventing information that does not match the text.  
- Listing facts without developing ideas.  
- Poor time management leading to rushed answers.  

### General Mistakes

- Spending too long on one question.  
- Not reading the question carefully.  
- Failing to check work.  
- Leaving any question blank.  
- Ignoring specific instructions such as word limits.

## 10. The 2027 Specification Changes

### Summary of Main Changes

#### Question 1

- More sub questions, with clearer numbering.  
- Line references made more precise.  

#### Question 2

- Fewer vocabulary questions overall.  
- The summary moves from Question 1 f to become Question 2 a.  
- A new five mark evaluation task follows the summary.  
- Vocabulary questions are renumbered.  
- Question 2 c is now worth five marks instead of three.  

#### Writer’s Effect

- One paragraph instead of two.  
- Three images or quotations instead of six.  
- Question worth ten marks rather than fifteen.  
- Extract printed alongside the question.  
- Word count reduced to 200 to 250 words.  
- Focus on powerful and unusual words and phrases.  

#### Question 3

- Slightly lower suggested word count.  
- Fewer marks for content.  
- Spelling, punctuation and grammar not assessed in a separate band, but clarity is still important.  

### The Core Message

The exam has been given a new layout, but the underlying skills remain the same.  

Core skills:

- Question 1: precise retrieval and accurate understanding.  
- Summary: careful selection of information and use of your own words.  
- Writer’s effect: detailed analysis of both explicit and implicit meaning.  
- Question 3: development of ideas, appropriate voice and coverage of all bullet points.  

### What Stays the Same

- The need to retrieve, infer, analyse and evaluate.  
- Most text types and formats.  
- The use of VORPF or similar frameworks to analyse tasks.  
- The summary word limit of 120 words.  
- Overall exam duration of 2 hours.  
- The importance of planning before writing.  

### Advice for Students Taking the 2027 Specification

1. Become familiar with the new paper layout early by using specimen papers.  
2. For writer’s effect, focus on depth rather than quantity.  
3. Practise the new five mark evaluation task that comes after the summary.  
4. Remember that even if spelling and grammar are not marked in a separate band, clarity still matters.  
5. Get used to the new numbering system so you are not confused in the exam.

## Final Tips for Success

### Golden Rules

1. Time management is crucial; practise under timed conditions.  
2. Read the questions before reading the texts so you know what to look for.  
3. Use your own words unless the question specifically tells you to copy.  
4. Plan briefly before each major writing task.  
5. Always leave a few minutes to check your work at the end.  

### What Examiners Want to See

Regular practice:

- Two full past papers each week.  
- One summary practice.  
- One writer’s effect analysis.  

Before the exam:

- At least ten complete past papers done under timed conditions.  
- Careful review of mark schemes.  
- Practice with all common text types for Question 3.  
- Confidence with paraphrasing techniques.  

### Remember

Success in Paper 1 comes from:

- Understanding how each question is marked.  
- Practising regularly under realistic timing.  
- Reading questions carefully.  
- Managing your time strictly.  
- Using the right technique for each question type.

## Evaluation: The Key to High Marks

Directed Writing is not just about repeating what the texts say.  
To reach the top reading bands, you must **evaluate**.

### Explicit Ideas Versus Evaluation

- **Explicit ideas**  
  - What the text says directly  
  - Example:  
    - Text A says: “Shopping will not save the planet.”  
    - Text B says: “We should not give up hope.”

- **Evaluation**  
  - Challenges, probes, and questions those ideas  
  - Example evaluation:  
    - “While Text A claims individual action is pointless, it contradicts itself by noting that most people want to help. If schools mobilise that majority, small actions could accumulate into significant change.”

**Cambridge’s definition of evaluation:**  

Understanding the **implicit attitudes, ideas, or logical weaknesses** in a writer’s argument and giving an effective counter-argument.

### What Evaluation Is Not

- Summarising the texts  
- Agreeing with everything  
- Giving your own random opinions  
- Making up statistics  

### How Many Evaluation Points?

- **1 evaluation point:** around 10 out of 15 for reading  
- **2 evaluation points:** around 11 out of 15  
- **3 evaluation points:** around 12 out of 15  
- **4 or more evaluation points:** 13–15 out of 15  

Just **one good counter-argument** already moves you into high marks.

### Simple Evaluation Methods

**1. The “But What About…?” Method**  

- Text: “Only governments can make a difference.”  
- Evaluation: “But what about the fact that governments are made of individuals? If nobody as an individual cares, governments will never act.”

**2. The “Flip It” Method**  

- Text: “Individual action is meaningless.”  
- Evaluation: “If everyone thinks this and does nothing, failure is guaranteed. Individual action may be small, but it is essential.”

**3. The “Scale Up” Method**  

- Text: “One person recycling makes no difference.”  
- Evaluation: “One person can influence a family, a class, or a community. Small actions multiplied create a ‘butterfly effect’.”

**4. The “Missing Link” Method**  

- Text: “Green shopping is just a trend; people only do it to feel good.”  
- Evaluation: “Even if people buy reusable bags just to feel good, the result still reduces waste. Outcomes matter more than motives.”

### Common Evaluation Angles by Topic

**Environmental and individual action**

- Both individual and collective action are needed  
- Small actions accumulate into big change  
- Governments and corporations are made of individuals  
- Education of young people shapes future voters and leaders  
- Motivation matters less than useful outcomes  

**Tourism and responsible behaviour**

- Tourists bring essential income  
- Tourism can fund conservation  
- The problem is irresponsible tourism, not tourism itself  
- Education can promote responsible choices  

**Technology and modern life**

- Technology brings benefits and drawbacks  
- The issue is not technology itself but how we use it  
- Balance between online and offline life is key

## VORPF Analysis Method

VORPF is your **planning compass** for every Paper 2 task.

### What Is VORPF?

- **V – Voice:** Who are you writing as?  
- **O – (not used here; you can treat this as “Overall stance” if helpful)**  
- **R – Register:** How formal or informal should you be?  
- **P – Purpose:** Why are you writing?  
- **F – Format:** What text type are you producing?  

*(You have been using the acronym VORPF; the core idea is the same as VARPF.)*

### Example Task

> Write an article for young people advising what to consider when choosing a holiday destination.

**VORPF analysis:**

- **Voice:** Journalist or adviser; mature, knowledgeable  
- **Audience:** Young people (older teenagers and young adults); teachers or parents might also read it  
- **Register:** Semi-formal; lively and engaging but serious about the topic  
- **Purpose:** Advise and inform, possibly persuade to be responsible  
- **Format:** Magazine article  

**Resulting style:**

- Use inclusive “we” and “you”  
- Semi-formal, energetic tone  
- Avoid slang and text speak  
- Use rhetorical questions and vivid vocabulary  

### Register by Format

**Formal letter**

- Greeting: “Dear Sir or Madam” or “Dear Mr Smith”  
- Sign-off: “Yours faithfully” or “Yours sincerely”  
- Polite, respectful tone  
- Professional vocabulary  

**Semi-formal letter**

- Greeting: “Dear [Name]”  
- Sign-off: “Best wishes” or “Yours sincerely”  
- Friendly but respectful  

**Speech**

- Direct address: “Ladies and gentlemen”, “Friends”, “Fellow students”  
- Rhetorical questions  
- Inclusive pronouns: we, us, our  
- Energetic, persuasive tone  

**Magazine article**

- Engaging headline  
- Semi-formal, lively style  
- May use humour where appropriate  
- May include subheadings  

**Formal report**

- Objective, factual style  
- Third person  
- Past or present tense depending on brief  
- Headings and sections  

**Interview**

- Q and A format  
- Spoken, natural language  
- Balanced contributions from interviewer and interviewee  

### Purpose Determines Tone

- **Persuade:** strong opinions, emotional language, calls to action  
- **Inform:** neutral tone, clear explanations  
- **Advise:** friendly, helpful, solution-focused tone  
- **Argue:** logical structure, evidence, clear stance  
- **Discuss:** balanced view, weighing pros and cons  

### Common VORPF Mistakes

- Using slang in a formal letter  
- Being too stiff and formal in a school magazine article  
- Forgetting you are writing as a specific character  
- Writing the wrong format (for example, a letter that reads like an essay)  

### Golden Rules of Register

1. Never use text-speak (tbh, lol, btw), emojis, or phrases like “gonna,” “wanna,” “gotta.”  
2. Always use **standard English** and correct grammar.  
3. Adapt your tone to:  
   - who you are,  
   - who you are writing to,  
   - what your purpose is.  

---

## Section A: Writing Your Response

### Organising Paragraphs

The big rule: **organise by theme or argument**, not by text order.

- **Avoid:**  
  - Paragraph 1: everything from Text A  
  - Paragraph 2: everything from Text B  
  - Paragraph 3: your own opinion  

- **Do instead:**  
  - Paragraph 1: one main theme (for example, environmental benefits), using ideas from both texts plus evaluation  
  - Paragraph 2: second theme (for example, economic issues), again using both texts plus evaluation  
  - Paragraph 3: solutions or application to the given context, again drawing on both texts  

Each paragraph should contain:

1. Topic sentence (what the paragraph is about)  
2. Explicit idea from Text A or Text B  
3. Your evaluation or counter-argument  
4. Supporting idea from the other text  
5. Another evaluation point  
6. A link or transition to the next paragraph  

### Example Topic Sentence

“While environmental concerns are valid, tourism also brings crucial economic benefits to local communities.”

This immediately signals the paragraph’s focus (economic benefits) and invites you to weave in ideas and evaluation from both texts.

### Openings and Closings

**Opening (2–3 sentences)**

- Grab attention  
- Establish your voice  
- State your purpose  

**Closing (2–3 sentences)**

- Summarise your position  
- End with a strong thought or call to action  

### Using Evidence from the Texts

- Always **paraphrase** ideas into your own words  
- Weave ideas naturally into your paragraphs  
- Only briefly refer to “the text” when necessary  

Example:

- Text: “Recycling figures are up, but the acquisition of consumer goods is also up.”  
- Your sentence: “Although people recycle more than ever, our constant appetite for new products means overall waste remains high.”  

### Vocabulary and Style for Section A

Aim for:

- Sophisticated but accurate word choices  
- Varied sentences  
- Clear transitions (furthermore, however, consequently, for instance)  
- Rhetorical devices used naturally:  
  - rhetorical questions,  
  - rule of three,  
  - emotive language,  
  - direct address where appropriate.  

Examiner reports praise responses that:

- pay careful attention to **audience and style**,  
- use ideas from the texts to **structure** arguments,  
- balance information with persuasion,  
- use devices such as questions and calls to action.  

---

## Section B: Composition – Narrative Writing

### What Is a Narrative?

A narrative is a **story** with:

- Events that actually happen  
- Characters who act and react  
- A clear beginning, middle, and end  
- A climax and some form of resolution  
- Some dialogue (optional but effective)  
- Character change or development  

Narrative writing answers a prompt by telling a **focused episode**, not a whole life story.

### Plot Structure: The Mountain

Think of plot as climbing and descending a mountain:

1. **Introduction**  
2. **Inciting incident** (optional but powerful)  
3. **Rising tension**  
4. **Climax**  
5. **Resolution**  

#### 1. Introduction

- Establish time (when)  
- Establish setting (where)  
- Introduce main character (who)  
- Hint at what they want or fear  

#### 2. Inciting Incident

- Event that disrupts normal life  
- Pushes character into action  

#### 3. Rising Tension

- Obstacles and complications  
- Increasing stakes  
- Building questions in the reader’s mind  

#### 4. Climax

- The most intense moment  
- Key decision, confrontation, or revelation  
- Answers the main story question  

#### 5. Resolution

- Brief, one paragraph is enough  
- Shows the outcome and emotional consequences  
- May return to an image or line from the beginning  

### The “Moment in Time” Principle

In an exam, you do **not** have time to write a full saga.

- Focus on **one episode** or **one intense situation**.  
- For example, not “Sammy’s whole life as an athlete” but “the ten minutes before and during the race.”

Keep to:

- one main character,  
- one main problem,  
- one key outcome.

### Characterisation

Create believable characters by showing:

- **Appearance:** how they look and move  
- **Actions:** what they do under pressure  
- **Speech:** how they talk  
- **Motivations:** what they want  
- **Flaws:** weaknesses or faults  

Example (showing motivation and flaw):

“Sammy had trained all year for the Tough Mudder, his seventh attempt at beating Benson. He was disciplined and determined, but also petty; he had turned a fun race into a personal war.”

### Dialogue

Dialogue should:

- Be brief and purposeful  
- Reveal character or move the plot forward  
- Be balanced with description and action  

Follow basic rules:

- New speaker, new paragraph  
- Use speech marks correctly  
- Do not write pages of pure dialogue  

Example:

“‘What is wrong?’ he asked, reaching for her hand.  
‘I do not know.’ She pulled away, scanning the dark trees. ‘But we need to find it. Now.’”

### Setting and Description

Use setting to create atmosphere:

- Weather, time of day, and surroundings can reflect mood  
- Remember to mention the setting throughout, not just in the first paragraph  

Use **show, do not tell**:

- Tell: “Sammy was nervous.”  
- Show: “Sammy’s hands trembled as he adjusted his race number for the third time.”

### Rising Tension and Climax

Use:

- Short, punchy sentences for speed and urgency  
- Strong verbs (raced, slammed, jolted)  
- Sensory detail  

Ensure the climax feels **earned**, not random. It should grow naturally from previous hints and obstacles.

### Circular Structure

A powerful technique is to end with a reference to your beginning.

- Opening: “It is the taking part that counts,” I muttered.  
- Ending: “Crossing the line beside Benson, I finally believed it was the taking part that counted.”  

This shows character growth and deliberate crafting.

### Common Narrative Mistakes

- Too many characters or plot lines  
- No clear climax  
- No ending because you ran out of time  
- Ignoring the given prompt  
- Overcomplicated time jumps and flashbacks  

---

## Section B: Composition – Descriptive Writing

### What Is Description?

Descriptive writing is like a **photograph**, not a film.

- You paint a picture of a place, person, or moment  
- Very little or no plot  
- Minimal or no dialogue  
- Narrator usually observes rather than acts  

### The Five-Paragraph Description Structure

A simple, effective structure:

1. **Zoom out – long shot**  
   - Describe the whole scene  
   - Set time, place, and atmosphere  

2. **Zoom in – detail one**  
   - Choose one small, symbolic detail  
   - Describe it in depth  

3. **Change perspective**  
   - Different viewpoint (another person, higher or lower angle)  

4. **Zoom in – detail two (contrast)**  
   - Another small detail that contrasts with the first  

5. **Emotional ending and circle back**  
   - Return to an image from paragraph one  
   - Show change or deeper meaning  

### Camera Movement Principle

Move logically through the scene:

- Left to right  
- Far to near  
- Outside to inside  
- General to specific  

### Using the Five Senses

Engage all senses:

- **Sight:** colours, shapes, shadows  
- **Sound:** volume, rhythm, silence  
- **Smell:** pleasant, unpleasant, memories  
- **Touch:** textures, temperature  
- **Taste:** food, or metaphorical taste (dust, fear)  

Example:

“The market hummed with layered voices. The air was thick with cinnamon, cardamom, and something earthier. Bursts of red tomatoes, golden mangoes, and emerald herbs crowded every stall. Rough baskets scratched my fingertips as I brushed past; the faint taste of dust lingered on my tongue.”

### Atmosphere and Tone

Decide the atmosphere before you write:

- Peaceful and calm  
- Tense and eerie  
- Joyful and lively  
- Melancholic and reflective  

Match your language and imagery to that mood.

### Extended Metaphor

Choose one extended metaphor and return to it:

- Night sky as a theatre  
- City as a beehive  
- Ocean as a living creature  

Example for night sky as theatre:

- Clouds as curtains  
- Stars as actors  
- Moon as the spotlight  

This creates unity and sophistication.

### Common Descriptive Mistakes

- Adding a full plot with events and dialogue  
- List-like description (this is here, that is there)  
- Overusing clichés  
- Only describing what things look like (no other senses)  
- No clear atmosphere  

---

## Advanced Writing Techniques

### Sentence Variety

Use:

- Simple sentences for impact  
- Compound and complex sentences for flow and detail  

Mix lengths:

- Short sentences build tension.  
- Longer sentences allow for reflection and description.  

### Punctuation for Effect

- **Semi-colon:** links closely related ideas  
- **Colon:** introduces an explanation or list  
- **Dash:** adds emphasis or an afterthought  
- **Ellipsis:** suggests hesitation or trailing off (use sparingly)  
- **Brackets:** add extra information (again, sparingly)  

### Show, Do Not Tell

- Tell: “She was angry.”  
- Show: “She slammed the door and her jaw tightened.”  

This makes your writing vivid and engaging.

### Pathetic Fallacy

Let the weather reflect emotions:

- Storm during conflict  
- Sunshine during happiness  
- Fog during confusion  

Do not overuse, but it can powerfully reinforce mood.

### Foreshadowing and Flashback

- Hints early in the story about what will happen later  
- Brief flashbacks can reveal motivation  

Use them carefully so your narrative remains clear in exam conditions.

### Vocabulary

Aim for precise, ambitious vocabulary that you **fully understand**.  
Simple and correct is better than complex and wrong.

## Writer's Effect

### **Example 1: Writers Effects Oct/Nov 2023 /11**

**Paragraph 2**

Paragraph 2 uses effective vocabulary to depict the airport’s concourse as a vast maze that passengers would have to navigate through to deposit their luggage, while creating a vaguely ominous atmosphere. The phrase “eerily silent” initially portrays the concourse as a spooky, quiet place. The word “eerily” conveys how the concourse’s silence was not a normal occurrence, and the lack of noise created an odd or unsettling feeling. It helps us understand that the concourse is normally a busy, thriving area, which was currently seemingly abandoned. It could also imply that the concourse was waiting for something to happen, owing to its uncommon silence, which would be effective foreshadowing. “Roped-off labyrinths” describes the concourse’s queue areas as twisting and confusing, in which passengers may get lost in. “labyrinths” uses effective comparison to create this effect. It emphasizes how the concourse may have a foreboding feeling to it, due to its maze-like structure and uncanny atmosphere. “Surrendered into safe hands” depicts the Golden Tour staff as saviors and protectors who would ensure the safety of passengers’ belongings, presumably from dangers present in the concourse. However, “surrendered'' could imply passengers being unwilling to let go of their belongings, despite having no choice but to. Overall, the paragraph creates a spooky effect to describe the concourse, contrasted by the Golden Tour’s offered protection.

**Paragraph 4**

Paragraph 4 depicts the approaching passengers as in need of assistance through its usage of vocabulary and comparisons. “Small knot of passengers wandering uncertainly” – this phrase uses multiple descriptive words to portray the passengers as worried or clueless about their surroundings, in dire need of help. “Small knot” initially shows us that they may be afraid to wander around alone, due to being worried about getting lost in a new environment. “Wandering uncertainly” expands on their lack of knowledge surrounding the concourse, as it shows how the passengers are simply moving about without any real purpose, unsure of what further steps to take. “Shaky dance” conveys how even their trolley seemed nervous. It shows us how their uncertainty showed in every step they took, and their lack of knowledge caused them to be unable to properly handle the trolley. It could also convey the absolute anxiety felt by the passengers while simply walking through through the concourse, which seemed to transfer over to their trolley as well. “Three disobedient suitcases” this phrase uses personification to heighten the sense of struggle as felt by the passengers. It showed how their stress and worry was not just due to inexperience, but also due to their circumstances adding more obstacles to their path. It depicted how there may be more to their anxious attitude than being in a new place, but also due to being unable to handle multiply problems such as the suitcases at once. “Disobedient” shows how the suitcases’ falling off was not a fault on their part, but rather, the suitcases’. Overall, the paragraph shows how the passengers were in urgent need of assistance so that they could manage their journey without any stress.

### **Example 2: 0500_w22_QP_12**

The writer uses a plethora of words and phrases to convey Veda's flair for the physical arts from an infantile age, despite her utter ineptitude in those more linguistic. It illustrates the sprouting of a superb dancer, who is likely to be misunderstood due to her non-traditional tendencies in the near future.

Firstly, the phrase "limbs urgently craving release" is a hyperbole, depicting how Veda was ensnared in her cot, which acted more like a confine than the comfortable home it was meant to be. This evinces her desire for freedom like a bird, with a passion for dexterity. This also provides insight into a potentially impatient, reckless mind which may be her undoing someday. It implies a passionate, caged being which could potentially foreshadow her parents blocking this path for her in the future.

Secondly, the phrase "hands spoke my first sentences like lotus bluds blossoming" is a simile, showing how her physical proficiency made up for her underdeveloped semantic capabilities. It depicts unconventional genius akin to that of a lotus blud blossoming, that is one of beauty and magnificence that would enchant the most austere of men. It foreshadows mockery in social environments due to linguistic ineptitude, which may lead Veda down a dark path.

Lastly, the phrase "effortlessly into the hand symbols of classical dancing" is a visual imagery, describing how Veda was able to dance without any prior knowledge, with "effortlessly" signifying a deep level of intuition for traditional culture. It depicts a smooth movement, perfectly transfigured into ancient symbols.

The effect on the reader is one of awe, while drawing a tinge of pity for the hardships Veda may face. It is also one of an ominous foreshadow, where her passion may lead her to depths to deep for one to handle.

### **Example 3: Taughtly A* Examplars**

*The overall effect of paragraph 9 is to show how skillful Sammy is as he climbs the hill like a master athlete. Firstly, the image of him "soaring through the mud" means he jumped so high it was like he flew. The verb "soar" has connotations of freedom like a bird, which suggests the course was effortless to him and how free he felt in that moment. Secondly, the image "pirouetted over the gorge" means Sammy twirled like a ballerina over the hole. The verb "pirouette" has connotations of control, mastery, and beauty, which suggests there is something artistic about how Sammy can tackle this obstacle course. Finally, the image of Sammy "swinging, swaying across with ease" means he moved with ease from one rope to another. The verb "swinging" has connotations of a monkey in a jungle, which implies that tackling Tough Mudder is natural to Sammy. All of this contrasts with how difficult the obstacle course is compared with how fluidly Sammy is able to approach the challenge.* 

*The overall effect of paragraph 10 is to show a magical and romanticized view of the underwater world. Firstly, the image of “shell-encrusted” means that the doorstep was completely covered by shells.This has connotations of being decorated by gems, showing how precious the location is and how the hotel blends in with its natural surroundings. Secondly, the image of clownfish “darting” means that the fish are rapidly zig-zagging all over. “Darting” has connotations of being agile, light and free, and this might reflect Jenny’s own excitement. Finally,the image of the anemone’s “swirling fingers” means that they aretwisting and wrapping around. “Swirling” has connotations of magic and dancing, suggesting even the landscape is performing for Jenny*

*● Paragraph 4 begins ‘Three hours later …’ and is about the writer’s reactions to*

*the creatures in the rainforest.*

*● Paragraph 6 begins ‘Next morning …’ and gives a description of the rainforest*

*as the writer wakes up after his first night camping there.*

**Paragraph 4:**

*Through the use of powerful adjectives, adverbs and verbs contributing to effective*

*imagery, the writer expresses his sheer joy and exuberance at the sight of the creatures*

*in the rainforest.*

*A crescendo in the excitement is evident in the phrase ‘bubbles of amazement and*

*wonder rising’ where the writer implies something exquisite coming to the surface to add*

*to the marvel. The word ‘bubbles’ has a childlike and playful connotation depicting the*

*innocent joy of discovering something fascinating. This is further enhanced by the*

*‘gliding lizards fly effortlessly’ which shows how the writer is clearly mesmerised by the*

*elegant and natural ease of movement of the reptiles as if to suggest some kind of*

*artistry at display. This astonishing effect is sustained by the ‘intricate dragonflies of*

*infinite varieties’ where the writer seems to be enchanted by the delicate and subtle yet*

*complicated pattern of designs as if an extraordinary piece of artwork has charmed him*

*beyond his wits.*

**Paragraph 6:**

*In this paragraph, the writer uses some brilliant descriptions of the flora and fauna of the*

*rainforest that almost create an irresistible temptation for the reader to pick up and*

*touch everything.*

*The phrase ‘fairy-tale landscape’ has a captivating impact on the readers, luring them to*

*this rainforest that is absolutely remarkable with a dream-like, magical and seemingly*

*unreal appeal to it. The writer compliments this further by talking about ‘frilled coral*

*cups’ painting a picture of underwater sea creatures with curved shapes and fringes*

*more like the decorative and fanciful borders to a lady’s dress. This makes it all the*

*more visually enthralling, transporting the readers to a utopian world. The phrase*

*‘brightly coloured confectionery’ builds on to the simmering temptation of this magical*

*rainforest by promising many a sugary and delectable treats to the visiting*

*traveller/camper that is sure to leave an indelible impression of this place on their*

*Minds.*

### **Example 5: Feb/March 2018 paper 22**

**Insert/Text**

**Paragraph 4:**

**Soon he was surrounded by ancient forest, footsteps muffled by centuries of discarded leaves. Myths of terrifying forest guardians suddenly seemed much more plausible as the endless acres of trees stood watch, stern sentinels of the trail. The silence was spellbinding as Bo crept onwards, down an almost subterranean tunnel of primeval greenery. Forwards, always forwards, an intruder in a magical**

**garden.**

**Paragraph 8:**

**Was it minutes or hours later? A sharp crack, loud as a gunshot, snapped him to attention. Ears straining, Bo quivered, listening for ravenous forest monsters ready to devour him in one gulp; or maybe a rogue bear or wild boar, hungry for hiker meat? Bo lifted the tent flap and peered into the gaping throat of the darkness, ready to be swallowed.**

**A* Response**

*The author describes the forest in a way which displays its ancient, yet mystical, aura. The phrase "centuries of discarded leaves" is used to denote the the way in which the leaves have accumulated over a period of time, in the absence of human intervention. An alliteration is used in the phrase "stern sentinels" to signify that the trees act as soldiers, on the lookout for trespassers. This effect is further enhanced with the use of personification in the same phrase. "Silence was spellbinding" is another phrase used by the writer to showcase the tranquility and stillness of Bo's surroundings. To explain that the forest has existed long before humanity, "primeval greenery" is used to indicate the forests age and continuity. Hence, the author clearly explains the forest in which Bo is hiking.* 

*Later on in the passage, the author describes Bo's reaction to the sudden noise in an exaggerated and overdramatic manner. For instance, in the phrase "loud as a gunshot", a simile is used to showcase Bo's fear and the startling intensity of the noise. "Ravenous forest monsters" is used to denote the imaginary creatures which Bo fears. To further enhance Bo's fear and dramatic acts, "devour him in one gulp" is used to indicate that the creatures can wolf him down easily. This is done with the help of visual imagery. The author uses a humorous tone in the phrase "ready to be swallowed" to indicate that Bo is accepting his fate of being consumed. Thus, the author vividly displays Bo's behaviour following the noise.*

### **Example 6: March 2022, Paper 1 Variant 2**

***The overall effect of paragraph 4 in "Into the Delta" is to evoke a sense of peace and deep connection with nature. The phrase "utter tranquillity of swishing through the water lilies in the open lagoons" uses auditory imagery to create a serene and calming atmosphere. The description of the mokoro as "gently floating as though blown through the perfectly clear water" further enhances this sense of peacefulness and harmony with the natural world. The imagery of the narrator "lay[ing] back on my backpack" contributes to a feeling of relaxation and being at one with the environment.***

### **Example 7**

***Insert/Text: Paragraph 1: The sand stretched before us, an ocean of gold frozen in time. Each dune rose and fell like a wave caught in perpetual motion, their crests sharp as a blade against the merciless blue sky. The sun, a tyrannical presence, beat down with such intensity that the air itself seemed to shimmer and dance, transforming the horizon into a trembling mirage. Our footprints, those temporary signatures of human presence, disappeared behind us as the wind, with delicate precision, erased all evidence of our journey. The silence was not merely the absence of sound but a presence in itself — ancient, profound, almost sacred in its completeness. As twilight approached, the landscape transformed; the harsh gold mellowed to amber, then to a soft rose, as if the desert, in its final act of the day, had decided to reveal its gentler nature.***

***Paragraph 2: The fishing village clung to the coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull, stubborn and enduring against the Atlantic's relentless assault. Weathered cottages, their stone faces bleached by salt and sun, huddled together as if for protection against the elements. The harbour, a patchwork of weathered boats and tangled nets, buzzed with the morning's activity — fishermen calling to one another in a dialect as rough and textured as the sea itself. The air was thick with the pungent cocktail of salt, fish and seaweed — an aroma that visitors wrinkled their noses at but that locals breathed in like perfume. Gulls wheeled overhead, their mournful cries punctuating the constant percussion of waves against rock. This place existed in a different tempo to the modern world, its rhythms dictated not by digital clocks but by tides and seasons, a living reminder of an older, slower way of life.***

***A* Answer Paragraph 1:***

***The writer uses personification to establish the desert as a conscious entity with agency rather than merely a passive landscape. This is evident when 'the wind, with delicate precision, erased all evidence of our journey'. By attributing intentional, careful action to the wind through phrases like 'delicate precision' and the verb 'erased', the writer suggests the desert actively removes human presence. The contrast between the 'delicate' nature of this action and its complete effectiveness emphasises the desert's power - it doesn't need brute force to remove traces of humanity, just subtle persistence. This contributes to the passage's theme of human insignificance against natural forces, reinforcing how temporary our impact is on such ancient landscapes. The personification creates a sense that the desert itself is an ancient, conscious entity that has witnessed countless human travelers come and go, leaving no lasting mark on its timeless existence.***

***A* Answer Paragraph 2:***

***By describing how 'The fishing village clung to the coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull, stubborn and enduring against the Atlantic's relentless assault', the writer creates a sense of the village as resilient and determined despite harsh conditions. Through this powerful combination of simile and personification, enhanced by carefully chosen adjectives like 'stubborn' and 'enduring' set against the personified 'assault' of the ocean, the writer establishes a vivid impression of tenacity. The barnacle comparison is particularly effective because barnacles are small yet incredibly tenacious creatures that survive in hostile environments — making them the perfect metaphor for this human settlement. The militaristic language of 'assault' skillfully establishes the relationship between village and sea as adversarial, suggesting an ongoing battle the village refuses to lose despite being perpetually outmatched in size and force. Rather than simply describing the village as 'located on the coast', this evocative phrasing establishes the central conflict of human persistence against natural forces that defines the village's character, immediately positioning readers to admire its inhabitants' determination and resilience in the face of constant environmental challenges.***

## How to Learn and Use Vocabulary Effectively

Where can I learn good vocab?  

- Read some poetry; look up and learn words you don't know.  
- Read short stories.  
- Read other people's descriptions.  
- Check out this thread on Discord.  

But **learn the meanings** and make sure they fit the sentence you are using them in. Also remember that there are other techniques than vocab that can make your description stand out.

It is better that you know how to use the words properly rather than just throwing them into your writing for the sake of it. Examiners would rather read something with well-understood words than “fancy” vocab. Those are marked higher too, because you have to use **precise** vocab according to the mark scheme and you can’t do that if you don’t fully know the meaning.

FLE doesn’t have to be poetic. You can use “big words” if you want to and can do it properly, **but** you can also use other techniques without using those things.

From **@skibidirizz__**:  

> “imo vocab only helps if it's smooth, to reach the top of the top a higher standard is there, but someone can perfectly reach A* with natural smooth flowing text containing metaphors and similes, parallel structures and so on”

---

### Critical Difference: Writing Style

Paper 2, Question 1 requires you to write in one of **three styles**:

1. **Persuasive** – convincing your audience to agree/act  
2. **Argumentative** – presenting balanced arguments and counter-arguments  
3. **Informative** – educating your audience on a topic  

Cambridge will **not** explicitly tell you which style – you must infer it using **VARPF**.

---

## The VARPF Framework: Your Writing Compass

Before writing **any** text type, analyse using **VARPF**:

- **V – Voice**  
  *Who are you writing as?*  
  Examples: student, teacher, journalist, employee, parent, local resident

- **A – Audience**  
  *Who are you writing to?*  
  Examples: classmates, teachers, general public, boss, friend, family

- **R – Register**  
  *How formal should your language be?*

  **Register Scale:**
  - **Formal:** reports, newspaper articles, formal letters (to bosses, officials)  
  - **Semi-formal:** speeches, magazine articles, semi-formal letters  
  - **Informal:** diaries, some informal letters (to friends/family)

  **CRITICAL RULE:**  
  Even for "informal" text types like diaries, Cambridge expects at minimum a **semi-formal** register.  
  You can **never** write in completely casual, slang-filled language. Even informal letters must keep grammatical correctness and appropriate vocabulary.

- **P – Purpose**  
  *Why are you writing?*

  **Common purposes:**
  - **Inform** – provide facts and information (newspaper reports, formal reports)  
  - **Persuade** – convince audience to agree or take action (speeches, persuasive letters)  
  - **Argue** – present balanced viewpoints on a controversial issue  
  - **Entertain** – engage and amuse (magazine articles, some journals)  
  - **Reflect** – share personal thoughts and feelings (journals, diaries)  
  - **Describe** – paint vivid pictures with words  

- **F – Format**  
  *What text type have you been asked to write?*  
  Interview, journal, magazine article, newspaper report, formal report, speech, or letter?

---

### VARPF in Action – Example

**Question:**  
Write a speech to your school assembly about the importance of environmental protection.

- **V (Voice):** Student environmental advocate  
- **A (Audience):** Fellow students and teachers at a school assembly  
- **R (Register):** Semi-formal (respectful but engaging)  
- **P (Purpose):** Persuade and inform  
- **F (Format):** Speech  

---

## Step-by-Step Approach: Paper 1, Question 3

**Target:** 400–450 words total (do *not* waste time counting words).

### Step 1: Read the Question Carefully

Identify:

- What **text type** are you writing?  
- Who are you writing as (**voice**)?  
- Who are you writing to (**audience**)?  
- What are the **three bullet points** asking for?

### Step 2: Highlight Keywords in the Question

Circle:

- Text type (letter, speech, article, report, etc.)  
- Your role/voice  
- Audience  
- Action verbs in bullet points (explain, suggest, evaluate, describe)

### Step 3: Read the Source Text (Passage/Text C)

- Read once for **overall understanding**  
- Read again, annotating for **each bullet point**

### Step 4: Plan Your Content on the Insert

Create a simple plan:

- **Bullet 1:** list around **5 explicit content points**  
- **Bullet 2:** list **5 explicit/implicit content points**  
- **Bullet 3:** list **4–5 implicit content points** (often fewer clear ideas; that’s okay if you develop them well)

Write at the top of your answer booklet:

- **V:**
- **A:**
- **R:**
- **P:**
- **F:**

This keeps you consistent throughout.

### Step 5: Think About VARPF

Fill in:

- **Voice:**  
- **Audience:**  
- **Register:**  
- **Purpose:**  
- **Format:**  

### Step 6: Write Your Response

**Structure (for all EXCEPT interviews):**

- Short **introduction** (1–3 sentences)  
- **Body paragraph 1** – Bullet point 1 (roughly 120–150 words)  
- **Body paragraph 2** – Bullet point 2 (roughly 120–150 words)  
- **Body paragraph 3** – Bullet point 3 (roughly 100–120 words)  
- Short **conclusion** (1–3 sentences)

### Step 7: Don't Count Words!

If you write:

- 1–3 sentence **intro**  
- 3 solid **paragraphs** (each about 10–12 sentences)  
- 1–3 sentence **conclusion**

…you will naturally hit **350–450 words**.

---

## Step-by-Step Approach: Paper 2, Question 1

**Target:** 300–350 words.

### Step 1: Read the Question and Scenario

Identify:

- **Text type**  
- **Voice and audience**  
- The **situation/context**  
- What the **three bullet points** are asking  

### Step 2: Identify the Style Required

Ask yourself:

- Am I trying to **persuade** someone? (Persuasive)  
- Am I presenting **arguments for and against**? (Argumentative)  
- Am I simply **educating/informing**? (Informative)  

### Step 3: Plan Your Content Points

- Bullet 1 → paragraph 1 ideas  
- Bullet 2 → paragraph 2 ideas  
- Bullet 3 → paragraph 3 ideas  

### Step 4: Apply VARPF

- **Voice**  
- **Audience**  
- **Register**  
- **Purpose**  
- **Format**  

### Step 5: Write Your Response

- Short **intro**  
- **3 body paragraphs** (one per bullet point)  
- Short **conclusion**

---

## Understanding Explicit vs. Implicit Content Points

### Explicit Points

- Directly stated in the text – **easy to identify**.

**Example from text:**  
"The hostel had uncomfortable, worn mattresses."

**Your response:**  
"The beds were incredibly uncomfortable, with thin, worn mattresses crammed together."

### Implicit Points

- Suggested or implied – you must **read between the lines**.

**Example from text:**  
"The window frame seemed welded shut, encrusted with years of dead flies."

**Implicit ideas you can infer:**

- No ventilation (fire hazard)  
- Extremely unsanitary conditions  
- Years of neglect and poor maintenance  
- Health and safety concerns  

---

### Content Points Per Bullet

**How many points do you need?**

- **Bullet 1:** usually **5 explicit** points (straightforward)  
- **Bullet 2:** usually **5 explicit or implicit** points (moderate difficulty)  
- **Bullet 3:** usually **4–5 implicit** points (most challenging, requires inference)

**Important:**  
The third bullet point often contains **fewer clear ideas** in the source text. You may only find **3–4 solid implicit points**, and that’s acceptable **as long as you develop each idea thoroughly**.

---

### Development Example

**Weak (no development):**  
"The hostel was dirty."

**Strong (well-developed):**  
"The hostel was in an appalling state of disrepair. Every surface was covered in grime, and the sinks were encrusted with years of neglect. The unsanitary conditions posed serious health risks, as guests could easily contract illnesses or infections from the filthy environment."

- Interviews and diaries appear **exclusively on Paper 1**

# 1. INTERVIEW WRITING

## Overview

An **interview** is a scripted conversation between two people, typically for radio, television, or podcast.

Cambridge interviews are **rarely job interviews** – they are usually conversational discussions about topics, experiences, or opinions.

## VARPF Analysis

- **Voice:** the interviewee (not you) – a character from the text  
- **Audience:** radio/TV/podcast listeners; local audience  
- **Register:** semi-formal (spoken language, but respectful)  
- **Purpose:** to inform; occasionally to entertain  
- **Format:** script with speaker names and colons  

## Example Past Paper Question

**Paper 1, Question 3 (October/November 2020)**

> Imagine you are a local radio presenter. You have invited a student from the text to discuss their experience with online learning during lockdown.  
>  
> **Write the words of the interview.**  
>  
> In your interview you should:  
> - Explain what challenges the student faced with online learning  
> - Describe how the student adapted to remote education  
> - Discuss the student's views on returning to in-person classes  

---

## Key Features of Interview Writing

### 1. Script Format

- Use each person's **name followed by a colon**  
- Start each new speaker on a **new line**  
- Use **correct punctuation and grammar** throughout  
- No quotation marks needed (it's already a script)

**Example:**

Interviewer: Could you tell us what happened that day?  
Mark: Well, I was actually in the library when the fire alarm went off. It was complete chaos – everyone was running around like startled ants. I had no idea what was going on.

---

### 2. Creating a Spoken Tone

Interviews should sound like **real conversation**, not stiff written text.

**Techniques:**

a) **Filler words** (use sparingly – 2–3 times max)  
- "Well, I guess..."  
- "Huh, I hadn't thought of that before..."  
- "You know..."  
- "Um, let me think..."  
- "Ah, that's a good question..."

b) Varied punctuation for natural pauses
- Ellipses (...) to show hesitation or trailing off
- Dashes (–) to show a change in direction
- Exclamation marks (!) for emphasis (use sparingly)

c) **Personal pronouns**
- Use "you," "your," "yours" to create direct conversation
- Have the interviewee speak directly to the interviewer
  - Example: "You really can't imagine how awful it was."

d) **Stage directions** (optional, in brackets)  
- (laughs) (nods) (pauses) (looks surprised) (sighs)  
- Use sparingly – 1–2 times maximum

---

### 3. Audience Awareness

Always address your listeners directly:

- "For those tuning in, I want you to consider..."  
- "Listeners, keep this in mind..."  
- "To all of you out there, I encourage you to think about..."  
- "I'm sure many of you can relate to..."  
- "For our audience who may not be familiar with..."  

---

### 4. Critical Cambridge Rule for Interviews

⚠ **ONLY write the THREE questions Cambridge gives you in the bullet points.**

**Do NOT:**

- Add extra questions  
- Reword Cambridge's questions significantly  
- Create a fourth or fifth question  

**DO:**

- Copy the three bullet points as your **three interview questions**  
- Let the interviewee answer each question **fully**  
- Have the interviewee do approximately **95% of the talking**

**Structure:**

1. Write **Question 1** (from bullet point 1)  
2. Interviewee answers fully  
3. Write **Question 2** (from bullet point 2)  
4. Interviewee answers fully  
5. Write **Question 3** (from bullet point 3)  
6. Interviewee answers fully  

No introduction or conclusion needed – just the interview.

---

## Annotated Example: Interview Writing (Short Excerpt)

Scenario: You are interviewing **Miss Salmon**, a teacher who pulled the fire alarm to avoid a classroom observation.

Interviewer: Miss Salmon, thank you for joining us today. Can you explain what led you to pull the fire alarm at Elmwood High School?  
Miss Salmon: Well, listeners, I appreciate the opportunity to share my side of the story. (pauses) It wasn't my finest moment, I'll admit that upfront. I was scheduled for a classroom observation with my year 11 English class – you know, the ones who seem to delight in making every lesson as challenging as possible. The pressure had been building for weeks, honestly. I'd spent countless hours preparing, staying up late planning the perfect lesson, but when the day arrived, I just... I couldn't face it. [...]

**Key Features Highlighted:**

- ✓ Only **three** questions (matching the bullet points)  
- ✓ Interviewee does **95% of the talking**  
- ✓ Spoken, **conversational tone**  
- ✓ Personal pronouns and direct audience address  
- ✓ Emotional authenticity  
- ✓ Stage directions used **sparingly**  
- ✓ Natural pauses (ellipses, dashes)  
- ✓ Semi-formal register maintained  

---

# 2. JOURNAL/DIARY WRITING

## Overview

A journal or diary is a **personal, reflective account** of events and emotions. Entries are **self-contained moments**, not full stories. They:

- Use **first-person voice**  
- Are **private and confessional**  
- Allow for **creative, emotional language**

## VARPF Analysis

- **Voice:** character from the text (first person)  
- **Audience:** yourself; private and confessional  
- **Register:** semi-formal (more relaxed, but still grammatically correct)  
- **Purpose:** to reflect; to express feelings and emotions  
- **Format:** personal entries with dates  

## Example Past Paper Question

**Paper 1, Question 3 (October/November 2022)**

> Imagine you are one of the students who participated in the school protest about environmental issues. **Write a journal entry** about your experience.  
>  
> In your journal you should:  
> - Describe what happened during the protest  
> - Explain your feelings about taking part  
> - Reflect on what you hope will change as a result

## Key Features of Diary Writing

### 1. Format and Greeting

Opening options:

- "Dear Diary,"  
- Just a date: "7th March 2021"  
- Date and time: "Monday, 15th November, 10:30 PM"

No formal sign-off needed – diaries are informal and personal.

---

### 2. Tone and Voice

Diaries are **confessional and introspective**. You should:

- Reveal **private thoughts and emotions**  
- Use first-person voice **consistently** ("I," "my," "me")  
- Avoid overly formal language (unless the character is formal)  
- Create a distinctive voice that feels **authentic**  
- Show **vulnerability and honesty**

---

### 3. Tense Usage

- **Past tense** – describing events:  
  - "The protest started at 9 AM this morning."  
- **Present tense** – current feelings and reflections:  
  - "I feel so angry about this."  

Mix both to show **event + reflection**.

---

### 4. Stylistic Features to Include

a) **Exclamation marks** for emotion and emphasis  
- "She stole my bag and ran away!"  
- "I couldn't believe my eyes!"

b) **Ellipses (...)** for pauses and uncertainty  
- "Well, I didn't know what to do in that situation... I never do."

c) **Rhetorical questions**  
- "Why do they always blame me for everything?"  
- "What was I supposed to do?"

d) **Emotive language**  
- "devastated," "thrilled," "overwhelmed," "frustrated," "exhilarated"

e) **Hyperbole**  
- "I've told you a million times!"  
- "The entire world was against me today."

f) **Idioms** (use carefully)  
- "I was absolutely fuming."  
- "My heart sank."

g) **Sentence fragments** (occasionally)  
- "Unbelievable."  
- "What a day."  
- "Never again."

Use all of these **sparingly** but effectively.

---

### 5. What Diaries Are NOT

- ❌ Not complete stories with full plot arcs, climax, and resolution  
- ❌ Not dialogue-heavy (avoid long direct speech)

Instead of:

> "She said, 'You're absolutely crazy!' and then I said, 'No, you are!' and then she said..."

Write:

> "She told me I was crazy, which I thought was completely unfair. I tried explaining my perspective, but she wouldn't listen."

**Key principle:** Transform ideas from the provided text into **personal reflections and emotional responses**.

---

### 6. Developing Ideas from the Text – Example

**Text idea:**  
"Students face constant bombardment of stress from all sides."

**Diary entry development:**

> "The strain is getting unbearable. My parents keep telling me I'm not doing enough – that I need to work harder, study longer, sleep less. My teachers assign mountains of homework every single week, each one acting like their subject is the only one that matters. Meanwhile, my brother sailed through his exams with A* grades, and everyone keeps reminding me of his success. 'Why can't you be more like him?' they ask. I feel so inadequate, like I'm constantly disappointing everyone around me. Will I ever be good enough?"

# Final Exam Tips and Common Mistakes

## Universal Writing Principles

1. **Always use your own words**
   - Never copy directly from the text  
   - Lifting words/phrases can lower marks  
   - Paraphrase and develop ideas

2. **Maintain consistency with VARPF**
   - Keep checking: voice, audience, register, purpose, format  
   - Ask halfway through:  
     - "Am I still writing in the right voice?"  
     - "Is my register still appropriate?"  

3. **Vary sentence structure**
   - Mix simple, compound, and complex sentences  
   - Short sentences for impact: "We must act now."  
   - Longer ones for complex ideas  

4. **Check SPAG (Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar)**
   - Proofread in the last 5 minutes  
   - Avoid comma splices, run-ons, incorrect apostrophes  

5. **Develop ideas beyond surface level**
   - Don't just state facts – explain **why** and **how**  
   - Show insight and logical connections  

6. **Structure matters**

   For **Question 3** (all text types except interviews):

   - Intro (1–3 sentences)  
   - Body paragraph 1 (Bullet 1)  
   - Body paragraph 2 (Bullet 2)  
   - Body paragraph 3 (Bullet 3)  
   - Conclusion (1–3 sentences)

   For **interviews**:
